Markov-Writer
=============

A proof of concept test of pseudo-Markov chaining to generate text from a database of samples it can build from existing text.

The current iteration uses three-word chaining to build sentences by looking at the previous three words when selecting the next.

The program is capable of applying rudimentary formatting on it's own to create the illusion of a "novel" with pseudo-random paragraphs and chapters.
